@article{Kuo2002,
abstract = {A simple pendulum model is used to study how feedforward and feedback can be combined to control rhythmic limb movements. I show that a purely feedforward central pattern generator (CPG) is highly sensitive to unexpected disturbances. Pure feedback control analogous to reflex pathways can compensate for disturbances but is sensitive to imperfect sensors. I demonstrate that for systems subject to both unexpected disturbances and sensor noise, a combination of feedforward and feedback can improve performance. This combination is achieved by using a state estimation interpretation, in which a neural oscillator acts as an internal model of limb motion that predicts the state of the limb, and by using alpha-gamma coactivation or its equivalent to generate a sensory error signal that is fed back to entrain the neural oscillator. Such a hybrid feedforward/feedback system can optimally compensate for both disturbances and sensor noise, yet it can also produce fictive locomotion when sensory output is removed, as is observed biologically. CPG behavior arises due to the interaction of the internal model and a feedback control that uses the predicted state. I propose an interpretation of the neural oscillator as a filter for processing sensory information rather than as a generator of commands.},

abstract = {Current understanding of how muscles coordinate walking in humans is derived from analyses of body motion, ground reaction force and EMG measurements. This is Part I of a two-part review that emphasizes how muscle-driven dynamics-based simulations assist in the understanding of individual muscle function in walking, especially the causal relationships between muscle force generation and walking kinematics and kinetics. Part I reviews the strengths and limitations of Newton-Euler inverse dynamics and dynamical simulations, including the ability of each to find the contributions of individual muscles to the acceleration/deceleration of the body segments. We caution against using the concept of biarticular muscles transferring power from one joint to another to infer muscle coordination principles because energy flow among segments, even the adjacent segments associated with the joints, cannot be inferred from computation of joint powers and segmental angular velocities alone. Rather, we encourage the use of dynamical simulations to perform muscle-induced segmental acceleration and power analyses. Such analyses have shown that the exchange of segmental energy caused by the forces or accelerations induced by a muscle can be fundamentally invariant to whether the muscle is shortening, lengthening, or neither. How simulation analyses lead to understanding the coordination of seated pedaling, rather than walking, is discussed in this first part because the dynamics of pedaling are much simpler, allowing important concepts to be revealed. We elucidate how energy produced by muscles is delivered to the crank through the synergistic action of other non-energy producing muscles; specifically, that a major function performed by a muscle arises from the instantaneous segmental accelerations and redistribution of segmental energy throughout the body caused by its force generation. Part II reviews how dynamical simulations provide insight into muscle coordination of walking.},

@article{Kitaoka1997,
abstract = {Eleven patients (fourteen feet) had resection of a coalition of the middle facet of the talocalcaneal joint because of symptoms that had been present for a mean of four years (range, 0.5 to nine years). The mean age at the time of the resection was seventeen years (range, thirteen to thirty-two years). Nine patients were male and two were female. Five feet had resection of the bone bridge with interposition of fat or tendon, and nine had resection without any interposed material. The mean duration of follow-up was six years (range, two to thirteen years). The clinical result was excellent for five feet, good for four, fair for three, and poor for two. Inversion was 8 +/- 4.5 degrees (mean and standard deviation) on the involved side and 17 +/- 6.2 degrees on the uninvolved side (p = 0.002). Three feet later had evidence of osteoarthrosis of the subtalar joint. Gait analysis demonstrated decreased motion of the hindfoot and the ankle, compared with that in normal subjects and with that in the contralateral (uninvolved) foot, in the sagittal and coronal planes during walking on a level surface. Motion was also reduced, particularly in the sagittal and coronal planes, during walking on a side slope. Ground-reaction forces (F8 and F9), temporal force factors (T2, T3, and T7), and the percentage of the gait cycle that consisted of the stance phase on the side-sloping walkway were different from those in normal subjects or in the uninvolved foot. These data indicate that, although most of our patients who had resection of a talocalcaneal coalition had a successful clinical result, most had a residual functional deficit.},

abstract = {Rotary blood pumps which have contact-less suspension are small, durable and widely used for left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). In order to design a total artificial heart (TAH) with rotary blood pumps, two pumps one for each ventricle, are controlled independently. Some of the challenges for the development of a TAH includes the requirement of a small size and the anatomical fitting of inlets and outlets which should be arranged closely on the circumference in the same direction. And they should be combined into a unit. In this paper, a helical flow total artificial heart (HFTAH) combing two centrifugal pumps with helical inlet in face is proposed in order to achieve a smaller TAH. To examine the pump performance, a preliminary test model for left ventricle was built, the size of the pump was 69.0mm in diameter and 45.0mm height. The size of the impeller was 44.0mm in diameter and 23.0mm height including a 15.0mm-height hydrodynamic bearing. The pump was externally driven by a direct current motor. 5.0L/min flow rate against 100mmHg pressure difference was obtained, where the total power consumption was 5.0W, the system efficiency was 23\% with a rotational speed of 2070rpm. In this system, maximum pressure head, flow rate and efficiency were 420mmHg, 15.0L/min and 26\%, respectively. In acute animal experiments with three healthy adult goats, the total biventricular bypass assist system using the pumps was able to maintain the maximum aortic flow at approximately 5.0L/min, and the pulmonary arterial flow at approximately 4.6L/min, the mean aorta pressure was 105mmHg, and the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 51mmHg. The development of the control method is undergoing, and a driving system and the pump aiming at the chronic animal experiments will be developed.},

abstract = {The plantigrade human foot rolls over the ground during each walking step, roughly analogous to a wheel. The center of pressure progresses on the ground like a wheel of radius 0.3 L (leg length). We examined the effect of varying foot curvature on the mechanics and energetics of walking. We controlled curvature by attaching rigid arc shapes of various radii to the bottoms of rigid boots restricting ankle motion. We measured mechanical work performed on the center of mass (COM), and net metabolic rate, in human subjects (N=10) walking with seven arc radii from 0.02-0.40 m. Simple models of dynamic walking predict that redirection of COM velocity requires step-to-step transition work, decreasing quadratically with arc radius. Metabolic cost would be expected to change in proportion to mechanical work. We measured the average rate of negative work performed on the COM, and found that it followed the trend well (r2=0.95), with 2.37 times as much work for small radii as for large. Net metabolic rate (subtracting quiet standing) also decreased with increasing arc radius to a minimum at 0.3 L, with a slight increase thereafter. Maximum net metabolic rate was 6.25 W kg(-1) (for small-radius arc feet), about 59\% greater than the minimum rate of 3.93 W kg(-1), which in turn was about 45\% greater than the rate in normal walking. Metabolic rate was fit reasonably well (r2=0.86) by a quadratic curve, but exceeded that expected from COM work for extreme arc sizes. Other factors appear to increase metabolic cost for walking on very small and very large arc feet. These factors may include effort expended to stabilize the joints (especially the knee) or to maintain balance. Rolling feet with curvature 0.3 L appear energetically advantageous for plantigrade walking, partially due to decreased work for step-to-step transitions.},

abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm, Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), for incremental real-time learning of nonlinear functions, as particularly useful for problems of autonomous real-time robot control that re- quires internal models of dynamics, kinematics, or other functions. At its core, LWPR uses locally linear models, spanned by a small number of univariate regressions in selected directions in input space, to achieve piecewise lin- ear function approximation. The most outstanding proper- ties of LWPR are that it i) learns rapidly with second order learning methods based on incremental training, ii) uses statistically sound stochastic cross validation to learn iii) adjusts its local weighting kernels based on only local in- formation to avoid interference problems, iv) has a com- putational complexity that is linear in the number of inputs, and v) can deal with a large number of—possibly redun- dant and/or irrelevant—inputs, as shown in evaluations with up to 50 dimensional data sets for learning the inverse dynamics of an anthropomorphic robot arm. To our knowl- edge, this is the first incremental neural network learning method to combine all these properties and that is well suited for complex on-line learning problems in robotics.},

abstract = {Patients with walking disorders are diagnosed by orthopedics and a rehabilitation course in a hospital, but the walking of physically unimpaired persons is not diagnosed. It is considered that if they continue to walk unstably, this may cause lower-back pain or knee pain; this burden also exerts bad influences upon other physical parts. So it is important that we analyze walking stability of physically unimpaired persons as one aspect of preventive medicine. The center of gravity (COG) plays an important role in evaluation of stability for both standing posture and walking. In the present study, we used an acceleration measurement system. Using this system, we measured the acceleration displacement at the COG of a normal walking subject and evaluated walking stability quantitatively. We noted the periodicity and rhythm of the acceleration displacement of normal subjects while they walked, using a seasonal adjustment model to predict periodic fluctuations. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using the ratio of the variance of the noise component vs. the variance of periodic component. This study provides useful information for understanding walking systems in preventive medicine and rehabilitative medicine.},

We validate the archi- tecture through a series of experiments, in which a human demon- strator teaches a humanoid robot simple manipulatory tasks. A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixturemodel). This provides ameasure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression. Finally, we analytically com- pute the trajectory which optimizes the imitation metric and use this to generalize the skill to different contexts.},

abstract = {Over time, leg prostheses have improved in design, but have been incapable of actively adapting to different walking velocities in a manner comparable to a biological limb. People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75-1.75 m s(-1) and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

@article{Blickhan2007,
abstract = {Research on the biomechanics of animal and human locomotion provides insight into basic principles of locomotion and respective implications for construction and control. Nearly elastic operation of the leg is necessary to reproduce the basic dynamics in walking and running. Elastic leg operation can be modelled with a spring-mass model. This model can be used as a template with respect to both gaits in the construction and control of legged machines. With respect to the segmented leg, the humanoid arrangement saves energy and ensures structural stability. With the quasi-elastic operation the leg inherits the property of self-stability, i.e. the ability to stabilize a system in the presence of disturbances without sensing the disturbance or its direct effects. Self-stability can be conserved in the presence of musculature with its crucial damping property. To ensure secure foothold visco-elastic suspended muscles serve as shock absorbers. Experiments with technically implemented leg models, which explore some of these principles, are promising.},

@article{Berthouze04,
abstract = {In a recent study on the pendulation of a small-sized humanoid robot (Lungarella \& Berthouze, 2002a,b), we provided experimental evidence that starting with fewer degrees of freedom enables a more efficient exploration of the sensorimotor space during the acquisition of a task. The study came as support for the well-established framework of Bernstein (1967), namely that of an initial freezing of the distal degrees of freedom, followed by their progressive release and the exploitation of environ- mental and body dynamics. In this paper, we revisit our study by introducing a nonlinear coupling between environment and system. Under otherwise unchanged experimental conditions, we show that a single phase of freezing and subsequent freeing of degrees of freedom is not sufficient to achieve optimal performance, and instead, alternate freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom is required. The interest of this result is twofold: (1) it confirms the recent observation by Newell \& Vail- lancourt (2001) that Bernstein’s (1967) framework may be too narrow to account for real data; (2) it suggests that perturbations that push the system outside its postural stability or increase the task complexity may be the mechanism that triggers alternate freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom.},

@article{Markowitz2011,
abstract = {Control schemes for powered ankle-foot prostheses would benefit greatly from a means to make them inherently adaptive to different walking speeds. Towards this goal, one may attempt to emulate the intact human ankle, as it is capable of seamless adaptation. Human locomotion is governed by the interplay among legged dynamics, morphology and neural control including spinal reflexes. It has been suggested that reflexes contribute to the changes in ankle joint dynamics that correspond to walking at different speeds. Here, we use a data-driven muscle-tendon model that produces estimates of the activation, force, length and velocity of the major muscles spanning the ankle to derive local feedback loops that may be critical in the control of those muscles during walking. This purely reflexive approach ignores sources of non-reflexive neural drive and does not necessarily reflect the biological control scheme, yet can still closely reproduce the muscle dynamics estimated from biological data. The resulting neuromuscular model was applied to control a powered ankle-foot prosthesis and tested by an amputee walking at three speeds. The controller produced speed-adaptive behaviour; net ankle work increased with walking speed, highlighting the benefits of applying neuromuscular principles in the control of adaptive prosthetic limbs.},

Once started on a shallow slope, a machine of this class will settle into a steady gait quite comparable to human walking, without active control or en ergy input. Interpretation and analysis of the physics are straightforward; the walking cycle, its stability, and its sensi tivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experi ments with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent research has focused on the design of intelligent prosthetic ankle devices with the goal of adapting behavior of the device to accommodate all walking surfaces that an individual encounters in daily life. To date, no studies have looked at how such devices perform on uneven terrain. METHODS: 11 young adults with unilateral transtibial amputation participated in two data collection sessions spaced approximately 3weeks apart. In each session they walked across a loose rock surface at three controlled speeds. In the first session, they wore a passive, energy storage and return prosthesis and in the second, they wore a powered prosthesis (BiOM, iWalk, Bedford, MA, USA). FINDINGS: Subjects had a 10\% faster self-selected walking speed when wearing the powered (1.16m/s) compared to unpowered prosthesis (1.05m/s; p=0.031). They walked with increased ankle plantarflexion on their prosthetic limb throughout the gait cycle when wearing the powered compared to unpowered prosthesis. This was especially evident in the increased plantarflexion during push-off (p<0.001). There was a small (<3°), but statistically significant decrease in knee flexion during early stance when wearing the powered device (p=0.045). Otherwise, the kinematics of the knee and hip were nearly identical when wearing the different devices. Subjects had decreased medial-lateral motion of their center of mass when wearing the powered prosthesis (p=0.020), but there were no differences in medial-lateral margins of stability between the devices (p=0.662). INTERPRETATION: Subjects did not significantly alter their proximal joint kinematics on this irregular surface as a result of the addition of power.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative sensitivity of center-of-pressure (COP)-based measures to changes in postural steadiness related to age. A variety of time and frequency domain measures of postural steadiness were compared between a group of twenty healthy young adults (21-35 years) and a group of twenty healthy elderly adults (66-70 years) under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The measures that identified differences between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in the young adult group were different than those that identified differences between the eye conditions in the elderly adult group. Mean velocity of the COP was the only measure that identified age-related changes in both eye conditions, and differences between eye conditions in both groups. The results of this study will be useful to researchers and clinicians using COP-based measures to evaluate postural steadiness.},

@article{mussa2000motor,
abstract = {In this paper we discuss a new perspective on how the central nervous system (CNS) represents and solves some of the most fundamental computational problems of motor control. In particular, we consider the task of transforming a planned limb movement into an adequate set of motor commands. To carry out this task the CNS must solve a complex inverse dynamic problem. This problem involves the transformation from a desired motion to the forces that are needed to drive the limb. The inverse dynamic problem is a hard computational challenge because of the need to coordinate multiple limb segments and because of the continuous changes in the mechanical properties of the limbs and of the environment with which they come in contact. A number of studies of motor learning have provided support for the idea that the CNS creates, updates and exploits internal representations of limb dynamics in order to deal with the complexity of inverse dynamics. Here we discuss how such internal representations are likely to be built by combining the modular primitives in the spinal cord as well as other building blocks found in higher brain structures. Experimental studies on spinalized frogs and rats have led to the conclusion that the premotor circuits within the spinal cord are organized into a set of discrete modules. Each module, when activated, induces a specific force field and the simultaneous activation of multiple modules leads to the vectorial combination of the corresponding fields. We regard these force fields as computational primitives that are used by the CNS for generating a rich grammar of motor behaviours.},

abstract = {The lumbar spine is of primary importance in gait and its development is influenced by the up- right posture adopted in human loco- motion. However, little is known about the kinematic behavior of the lumbar spine during walking. The aim of this study was to examine (1) lumbar spine kinematics during walking, (2) the effect of walking ve- locity on lumbar motion patterns and (3) the coupling characteristics of ro- tation and bending. In 22 volunteers aged 15–57 years, the three-dimen- sional displacements of T12 to the sacrum were sampled during elemen- tary movements of the trunk and dur- ing walking on a treadmill at four walking velocities. A three-dimen- sional electrogoniometer (CA 6000 Spine Motion Analyzer) sampling at 100 Hz was used. We analyzed max- imal primary and coupled motion ranges (ROM) and velocities in each plane. Lumbar ROM during walking did not exceed 40\% of maximal ac- tive ROM. Transverse plane ROM and frontal and transverse velocities increased with walking velocity. Coupling of rotation and bending during walking was individually variable and dependent on walking velocity. Moreover, the smoothness of the bending-rotation path varied with walking velocity. A simplified envelope of lumbar coupling charac- teristics during walking is presented, and the existence of an individually variable walking speed that is char- acterized by a more harmonic lumbar contribution is hypothesized.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the neuromuscular locomotor system is optimized at a unique speed by examining the variability of the ground reaction force (GRF) pattern during walking in relation to different constant speeds. Ten healthy male subjects were required to walk on a treadmill at 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 km/h. Three components [vertical (F(z)), anteroposterior (F(y)), and mediolateral (F(x)) force] of the GRF were independently measured for approximately 35 steps consecutively for each leg. To quantify the GRF pattern, five indexes (first and second peaks of F(z), first and second peaks of F(y), and F(x) peak) were defined. Coefficients of variation were calculated for these five indexes to evaluate the GRF variability for each walking speed. It became clear for first and second peaks of F(z) and F(x) peak that index variabilities increased in relation to increments in walking speed, whereas there was a speed (5.5-5.8 km/h) at which variability was minimum for first and second peaks of F(y), which were related to forward propulsion of the body. These results suggest that there is "an optimum speed" for the neuromuscular locomotor system but only for the propulsion control mechanism.},

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanical design, control scheme, and clinical evaluation of a novel, motorized ankle-foot prosthesis, called MIT Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis. Unlike a conventional passive-elastic ankle-foot prosthesis, this prosthesis can provide active mechanical power during the stance period of walking. The basic architecture of the prosthesis is a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. With this architecture, the anklefoot prosthesis matches the size and weight of the human ankle, and is also capable of delivering high mechanical power and torque observed in normal human walking. We also propose a biomimetic control scheme that allows the prosthesis to mimic the normal human ankle behavior during walking. To evaluate the performance of the prosthesis, we measured the rate of oxygen consumption of three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds to estimate the metabolic walking economy. We find that the powered prosthesis improves amputee metabolic economy from 7\% to 20\% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses (Flex-Foot Ceterus and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is twofold heavier than the conventional devices. This result highlights the benefit of performing net positive work at the ankle joint to amputee ambulation and also suggests a new direction for further advancement of an ankle-foot prosthesis.},

abstract = {Principles of muscle coordination in gait have been based largely on analyses of body motion, ground reaction force and EMG measurements. However, data from dynamical simulations provide a cause-effect framework for analyzing these measurements; for example, Part I (Gait Posture, in press) of this two-part review described how force generation in a muscle affects the acceleration and energy flow among the segments. This Part II reviews the mechanical and coordination concepts arising from analyses of simulations of walking. Simple models have elucidated the basic multisegmented ballistic and passive mechanics of walking. Dynamical models driven by net joint moments have provided clues about coordination in healthy and pathological gait. Simulations driven by muscle excitations have highlighted the partial stability afforded by muscles with their viscoelastic-like properties and the predictability of walking performance when minimization of metabolic energy per unit distance is assumed. When combined with neural control models for exciting motoneuronal pools, simulations have shown how the integrative properties of the neuro-musculo-skeletal systems maintain a stable gait. Other analyses of walking simulations have revealed how individual muscles contribute to trunk support and progression. Finally, we discuss how biomechanical models and simulations may enhance our understanding of the mechanics and muscle function of walking in individuals with gait impairments.},

@article{Garcia1998,
abstract = {We demonstrate that an irreducibly simple, uncontrolled, two-dimensional, two-link model, vaguely resembling human legs, can walk down a shallow slope, powered only by gravity. This model is the simplest special case of the passive-dynamic models pioneered by McGeer (1990a). It has two rigid massless legs hinged at the hip, a point-mass at the hip, and infinitesimal point-masses at the feet. The feet have plastic (no-slip, no-bounce) collisions with the slope surface, except during forward swinging, when geometric interference (foot scuffing) is ignored. After nondimensionalizing the governing equations, the model has only one free parameter, the ramp slope gamma. This model shows stable walking modes similar to more elaborate models, but allows some use of analytic methods to study its dynamics. The analytic calculations find initial conditions and stability estimates for period-one gait limit cycles. The model exhibits two period-one gait cycles, one of which is stable when 0 < gamma < 0.015 rad. With increasing gamma, stable cycles of higher periods appear, and the walking-like motions apparently become chaotic through a sequence of period doublings. Scaling laws for the model predict that walking speed is proportional to stance angle, stance angle is proportional to gamma 1/3, and that the gravitational power used is proportional to v4 where v is the velocity along the slope.},

abstract = {An improved characterization of the dynamics of postural sway can provide a better understanding about the functional organization of the postural control system as well as a more robust tool for postural pattern recognition. To this aim, a novel parameterization was applied to the stabilogram diffusion analysis formerly proposed by Collins and De Luca [Collins JJ, De Luca CJ. Open-loop and closed-loop control of posture: a random-walk analysis of center-of-pressure trajectories. Exp Brain Res 1993;95:308-18] that considered the act of maintaining posture as a stochastic process. The main purpose of the present technique was to overcome some drawbacks of the model presented by Collins and De Luca that may restrain its potential application in clinical practice. The approach uses a unique non-linear model to describe the center of pressure (COP) dynamics that reduces the number of parameters and decreases their intra-subject variability; consequently, fewer trials are required to perform reliable estimates of stochastic parameters and this is of particular importance for subjects that cannot afford many repeated measurements because of age or pathology. Four new statistical mechanics parameters (NSMP) were computed on the log-log stabilogram diffusion plots and their estimates were compared in terms of reliability and sensitivity to the visual conditions with: (1) a minimal set of four summary statistic scores (SSS); and (2) the six statistical mechanics parameters (SMP) proposed by Collins and De Luca. All four NSMP showed at least a fair-to-good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC>0.49) while SMP (ICC>0.20) showed some poor reliability. A better overall reliability was also observed with respect to SSS. Moreover, only NSMP had a similar score for eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Three out of four NSMP were also significantly sensitive to eyes open or closed conditions (P<0.001) while only three out of six SMP were sensitive to operating conditions (P<0.01).},

abstract = {Rhythmic and discrete movements are frequently considered separately inmotor control, probably because dif- ferent techniques are commonly used to study and model them. Yet the increasing interest in finding a comprehensive model formovement generation requires bridging the differ- ent perspectives arising from the study of those two types of movements. In this article,we consider discrete and rhythmic movements within the framework of motor primitives, i.e., of modular generation of movements. In this way we hope to gain an insight into the functional relationships between discrete and rhythmicmovements and thus into a suitable rep- resentation for both of them.Within this framework we can define four possible categories of modeling for discrete and rhythmic movements depending on the required command signals and on the spinal processes involved in the genera- tion of themovements. These categories are first discussed in terms of biological concepts such as force fields and central pattern generators and then illustrated by several mathemat- ical models based on dynamical system theory.Adiscussion on the plausibility of theses models concludes the work.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling, a rapid prototyping technology, was used to produce novel scaffolds with honeycomb-like pattern, fully interconnected channel network, and controllable porosity and channel size. A bioresorbable polymer poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) was developed as a filament modeling material to produce porous scaffolds, made of layers of directionally aligned microfilaments, using this computer-controlled extrusion and deposition process. The PCL scaffolds were produced with a range of channel size 160-700 microm, filament diameter 260-370 microm and porosity 48-77\%, and regular geometrical honeycomb pores, depending on the processing parameters. The scaffolds of different porosity also exhibited a pattern of compressive stress-strain behavior characteristic of porous solids under such loading. The compressive stiffness ranged from 4 to 77 MPa, yield strength from 0.4 to 3.6 MPa and yield strain from 4\% to 28\%. Analysis of the measured data shows a high correlation between the scaffold porosity and the compressive properties based on a power-law relationship.},

abstract = {In the present study we investigated in vivo length changes in the fascicles and tendon of the human gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle during walking. The experimental protocol involved real-time ultrasound scanning of the GM muscle, recording of the electrical activity of the muscle, measurement of knee- and ankle-joint rotations, and measurement of ground reaction forces in six men during walking at 3 km h(-1) on a treadmill. Fascicular lengths were measured from the sonographs recorded. Musculotendon complex length changes were estimated from anatomical and joint kinematic data. Tendon length changes were obtained combining the musculotendon complex and fascicular length-change data. The fascicles followed a different length-change pattern from those of the musculotendon complex and tendon throughout the step cycle. Two important features emerged: (i) the muscle contracted near-isometrically in the stance phase, with the fascicles operating at ca. 50 mm; and (ii) the tendon stretched by ca. 7 mm during single support, and recoiled in push-off. The behaviour of the muscle in our experiment indicates consumption of minimal metabolic energy for eliciting the contractile forces required to support and displace the body. On the other hand, the spring-like behaviour of the tendon indicates storage and release of elastic-strain energy. Either of the two mechanisms would favour locomotor economy},

abstract = {Lower extremity amputation not only limits mobility, but also increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis of the intact limb. Dynamic walking models of non-amputees suggest that pushing-off from the trailing limb can reduce collision forces on the leading limb. These collision forces may determine the peak knee external adduction moment (EAM), which has been linked to the development of knee OA in the general population. We therefore hypothesized that greater prosthetic push-off would lead to reduced loading and knee EAM of the intact limb in unilateral transtibial amputees. Seven unilateral transtibial amputees were studied during gait under three prosthetic foot conditions that were intended to vary push-off. Prosthetic foot-ankle push-off work, intact limb knee EAM and ground reaction impulses for both limbs during step-to-step transition were measured. Overall, trailing limb prosthetic push-off work was negatively correlated with leading intact limb 1st peak knee EAM (slope=-.72±.22; p=.011). Prosthetic push-off work and 1st peak intact knee EAM varied significantly with foot type. The prosthetic foot condition with the least push-off demonstrated the largest knee EAM, which was reduced by 26\% with the prosthetic foot producing the most push-off. Trailing prosthetic limb push-off impulse was negatively correlated with leading intact limb loading impulse (slope=-.34±.14; p=.001), which may help explain how prosthetic limb push-off can affect intact limb loading. Prosthetic feet that perform more prosthetic push-off appear to be associated with a reduction in 1st peak intact knee EAM, and their use could potentially reduce the risk and burden of knee osteoarthritis in this population.},

abstract = {We measured variability of foot placement during gait to test whether lateral balance must be actively controlled against dynamic instability. The hypothesis was developed using a simple dynamical model that can walk down a slight incline with a periodic gait resembling that of humans. This gait is entirely passive except that it requires active control for a single unstable mode, confined mainly to lateral motion. An especially efficient means of controlling this instability is to adjust lateral foot placement. We hypothesized that similar active feedback control is performed by humans, with fore-aft dynamics stabilized either passively or by very low-level control. The model predicts that uncertainty within the active feedback loop should result in variability in foot placement that is larger laterally than fore-aft. In addition, loss of sensory information such as by closing the eyes should result in larger increases in lateral variability. The control model also predicts a slight coupling between step width and length. We tested 15 young normal human subjects and found that lateral variability was 79\% larger than fore-aft variability with eyes open, and a larger increase in lateral variability (53\% vs. 21\%) with eyes closed, consistent with the model's predictions. We also found that the coupling between lateral and fore-aft foot placements was consistent with a value of 0.13 predicted by the control model. Our results imply that humans may harness passive dynamic properties of the limbs in the sagittal plane, but must provide significant active control in order to stabilize lateral motion.},

@article{VanHedel2006,
abstract = {During rehabilitation, many patient groups are being trained using bodyweight-supported treadmill training. However, little is known about modulation of time and distance parameters, joint movements and leg muscle EMG patterns by very low walking speeds or partial bodyweight unloading. We collected data from 20 healthy young volunteers who walked on a treadmill at walking speeds varying between 0.5 and 5.0 km h(-1) (0.14-1.39 ms(-1)) and with 0\%, 25\%, 50\% and 75\% bodyweight unloading. We found that cadence and stride length were largely influenced by walking speed, while bodyweight unloading influenced these measures only at 75\%. However, the relative duration of the gait phases changed largely only at walking speeds less than 2.5 km h(-1), but was influenced by all different bodyweight unloading conditions. Joint trajectories of knee and ankle joint, as well as leg muscle EMG activity patterns changed largely at walking speeds slower than 2.5 km h(-1) and with 75\% bodyweight unloading. We concluded that the parameters we investigated changed minimally at walking speeds faster than 2.5 km h(-1) and bodyweight unloading conditions less than 50\%. Therefore, standards for EMG activity and joint angle trajectories should only be compared when the training is done with velocities higher than 2.5 km h(-1) and less than 50\% body weight unloading.},

@article{townsend1985biped,
abstract = {It is shown that stable biped gaits can be achieved by discrete foot placement based on feedback of information available at the time of foot placement. The model, developed by Townsend (1981, J. Biomechanics14, p. 727) to evaluate the coordinations of torso motions, subsumes most of the salient body members and motions. The modeling yielded a generalized inverted pendulum with a movable support point which physically defines lateral foot placement. The principla result is that stable gaits can be defined by foot placements which are a linear function of the system center of mass position and vleocity at the time of foot placement (only). Gaits may be ‘smooth’ or may have impulsive corrections to adjust the character of the motions and foot placement. Several general algorithms and specific simulations are presented, and calculations for non-impulsive gaits and impulsive corrections are presented. The model predictions are compared with published data. The predictions are sufficiently close to the data such that the general algorithms appear to be validated. Of particular interest are the non-sinusoidal character of the motions and the relatively simple algorithms. Indeed, the simplicity of the algorithms suggests the practical possibility of legged mobile robots. Accordingly, further investigation seems warranted for determining the parametric variation and control of gait. Some attention is also given to continuous-feedback control such as would exist during double-leg support and in specialized tasks such as rope walking or skating. Subsequent investigation will consider superposition of single and double leg support, although clearly the discrete gaits pose the more restrictive stability problem.},

@article{Bogin2010,
abstract = {Decomposing stature into its major components is proving to be a useful strategy to assess the antecedents of disease, morbidity and death in adulthood. Human leg length (femur + tibia), sitting height (trunk length + head length) and their proportions, for example, (leg length/stature), or the sitting height ratio (sitting height/stature x 100), among others) are associated with epidemiological risk for overweight (fatness), coronary heart disease, diabetes, liver dysfunction and certain cancers. There is also wide support for the use of relative leg length as an indicator of the quality of the environment for growth during infancy, childhood and the juvenile years of development. Human beings follow a cephalo-caudal gradient of growth, the pattern of growth common to all mammals. A special feature of the human pattern is that between birth and puberty the legs grow relatively faster than other post-cranial body segments. For groups of children and youth, short stature due to relatively short legs (i.e., a high sitting height ratio) is generally a marker of an adverse environment. The development of human body proportions is the product of environmental x genomic interactions, although few if any specific genes are known. The HOXd and the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) are genomic regions that may be relevant to human body proportions. For example, one of the SHOX related disorders is Turner syndrome. However, research with non-pathological populations indicates that the environment is a more powerful force influencing leg length and body proportions than genes. Leg length and proportion are important in the perception of human beauty, which is often considered a sign of health and fertility.},

Late-stage changes may render the hallux painful and without functional utility, leading to impaired gait. Various environmental, genetic, and anatomical predispositions have been suggested, but the exact cause of hallux valgus is unknown. Evidence indicates that conservative intervention for hallux valgus provides relief from symptoms but does not reverse deformity. Part 1 of this perspective article reviews the literature describing the anatomy, pathomechanics, and etiology of hallux valgus. Part 2 expands on the biomechanical initiators of hallux valgus attributed to the first metatarsal. Theory is advanced that collapse of the arch with vertical orientation (tilt) of the first metatarsal axis initiates deformity. To counteract the progression of hallux valgus, we use theory to discuss a possible mechanism by which foot orthoses can bolster the arch and reorient the first metatarsal axis horizontally.},

Acceleration detection thresholds from these short moves were compared in standing vs seated conditions using a 2- Alternative [Interval] Forced-Choice psychophysical test protocol. A negative power law trading relationship was found between peak acceleration threshold and move length and duration for standing subjects. For these same subjects while seated, acceleration thresholds for all lengths were nearly constant, and showed a weak positive power law trade between threshold and move length or duration. This latter observation is consistent with that of Benson et al ’86, who also observed a positive power law trade relationship between acceleration threshold and move duration for seated subjects. Thresholds were higher at 1mm for standing vs. seated tests; while at 16 mm, standing tests had lower thresholds compared to those obtained for the seated tests. These results suggest that the vestibular system provides the principal input for detecting these short translations while seated, but not while standing.},

People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75-1.75 m s(-1) and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

@article{Thelen2006,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an efficient methodology for generating muscle-actuated simulations of human walking that closely reproduce experimental measures of kinematics and ground reaction forces. We first introduce a residual elimination algorithm (REA) to compute pelvis and low back kinematic trajectories that ensure consistency between whole-body dynamics and measured ground reactions. We then use a computed muscle control (CMC) algorithm to vary muscle excitations to track experimental joint kinematics within a forward dynamic simulation. CMC explicitly accounts for delays in muscle force production resulting from activation and contraction dynamics while using a general static optimization framework to resolve muscle redundancy. CMC was used to compute muscle excitation patterns that drove a 21-degrees-of-freedom, 92 muscle model to track experimental gait data of 10 healthy young adults. Simulated joint kinematics closely tracked experimental quantities (mean root-mean-squared errors generally less than 1 degrees), and the time histories of muscle activations were similar to electromyographic recordings. A simulation of a half-cycle of gait could be generated using approximately 30 min of computer processing time. The speed and accuracy of REA and CMC make it practical to generate subject-specific simulations of gait.},

We study two main issues: 1) Compliance and semi-passive dy- namics for locomotion of humanoid robots regarding robustness against unknown external perturbations; 2) The advantages of a bio-inspired multi-articulated vertebral column. We combine mechatronic compliance with structural compli- ance due to the use of flexible materials. And we explore how these capabilities allow to enforce morphological computation in the design of robust dynamic locomotion.We also investigate the use of compliance to design semi-passive motor primitives using the torso and the arms as a system of accumulation/release of potential/kinetic energy.},

abstract = {Algorithms to predict heelstrike and toeoff times during normal walking using only kinematic data are presented. The accuracy of these methods was compared with the results obtained using synchronized force platform recordings of two subjects walking at a variety of speeds for a total of 12 trials. Using a 60Hz data collection system, the absolute value errors (AVE) in predicting heelstrike averaged 4.7ms, while the AVE in predicting toeoff times averaged 5.6ms. True average errors (negative for an early prediction) were +1.2ms for both heelstrike and toeoff, indicating that no systematic errors occurred. It was concluded that the proposed algorithms provide an easy and reliable method of determining event times during walking when kinematic data are collected, with a considerable improvement in resolution over visual inspection of video records, and could be utilized in conjunction with any 2-D or 3-D kinematic data collection system.},

abstract = {Mastery of reaching and manipulation relies on adequate postural control. The trunk must be balanced relative to a base of support to allow free movements of the arms and hands. Moreover, the head must be supported flexibly by the trunk so that gaze can be directed toward the target to provide a spatial frame of reference for reaching. For fine manipulation it is also crucial to avoid retinal slips which would introduce blur. Stabilizing gaze is generally accomplished through adjustments of both eye and head position. Until gaze is stabilized, it is difficult to establish a frame of reference between the target and the self. Thus, a nested hierarchy of support involving the eyes, head, and trunk forms an important foundation for manual activity.},

abstract = {An active ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) is presented where the impedance of the orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat drop-foot gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.},

@article{Maus2010a,
abstract = {Habitual bipedalism is considered as a major breakthrough in human evolution and is the defining feature of hominins. Upright posture is presumably less stable than quadrupedal posture, but when using external support, for example, toddlers assisted by their parents, postural stability becomes less critical. In this study, we show that humans seem to mimic such external support by creating a virtual pivot point (VPP) above their centre of mass. A highly reduced conceptual walking model based on this assumption reveals that such virtual support is sufficient for achieving and maintaining postural stability. The VPP is experimentally observed in walking humans and dogs and in running chickens, suggesting that it might be a convenient emergent behaviour of gait mechanics and not an intentional locomotion behaviour. Hence, it is likely that even the first hominis may have already applied the VPP, a mechanism that would have facilitated the development of habitual bipedalism.},

abstract = {Robotics researchers increasingly agree that ideas from biology and self-organization can strongly benefit the design of autonomous robots. Biological organisms have evolved to perform and survive in a world characterized by rapid changes, high uncertainty, indefinite richness, and limited availability of information. Industrial robots, in contrast, operate in highly controlled environments with no or very little uncertainty. Although many challenges remain, concepts from biologically inspired (bio-inspired) robotics will eventually enable researchers to engineer machines for the real world that possess at least some of the desirable properties of biological organisms, such as adaptivity, robustness, versatility, and agility.},

abstract = {This article summarizes our framework for learning biped locomotion using dynamical movement primitives based on nonlinear oscillators. Our ultimate goal is to establish a design principle of a controller in order to achieve natural human-like locomotion. We suggest dynamical movement primitives as a central pattern generator (CPG) of a biped robot, an approach we have previously proposed for learning and encoding complex human movements. Demonstrated trajectories are learned through movement primitives by locally weighted regression, and the frequency of the learned trajectories is adjusted automatically by a frequency adaptation algorithm based on phase resetting and entrainment of coupled oscillators. Numerical simulations and experimental imple- mentation on a physical robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed locomotion controller. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phase resetting contributes to robustness against external perturbations and environmental changes by numerical simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {The trajectory of the heel and toe during the swing phase of human gait were analyzed on young adults. The magnitude and variability of minimum toe clearance and heel-contact velocity were documented on 10 repeat walking trials on 11 subjects. The energetics that controlled step length resulted from a separate study of 55 walking trials conducted on subjects walking at slow, natural, and fast cadences. A sensitivity analysis of the toe clearance and heel-contact velocity measures revealed the individual changes at each joint in the link-segment chain that could be responsible for changes in those measures. Toe clearance was very small (1.29 cm) and had low variability (about 4 mm). Heel-contact velocity was negligible vertically and small (0.87 m/s) horizontally. Six joints in the link-segment chain could, with very small changes (+/- 0.86 degrees - +/- 3.3 degrees), independently account for toe clearance variability. Only one muscle group in the chain (swing-phase hamstring muscles) could be responsible for altering the heel-contact velocity prior to heel contact. Four mechanical power phases in gait (ankle push-off, hip pull-off, knee extensor eccentric power at push-off, and knee flexor eccentric power prior to heel contact) could alter step length and cadence. These analyses demonstrate that the safe trajectory of the foot during swing is a precise endpoint control task that is under the multisegment motor control of both the stance and swing limbs.},

abstract = {Control schemes for powered ankle-foot prostheses rely upon fixed torque-ankle state relationships obtained from measurements of intact humans walking at target speeds and across known terrains. Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

abstract = {A new conceptual and theoretical framework for studying the human postural control system is introduced. Mathematical techniques from statistical mechanics are developed and applied to the analysis and interpretation of stabilograms. This work was based on the assumption that the act of maintaining an erect posture could be viewed, in part, as a stochastic process. Twenty-five healthy young subjects were studied under quite-standing conditions. Center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories were analyzed as one-dimensional and two-dimensional random walks. This novel approach led to the extraction of repeatable, physiologically meaningful parameters from stabilograms. It is shown that although individual stabilograms for a single subject were highly variable and random in appearance, a consistent, subject-specific pattern emerged with the generation of averaged stabilogram-diffusion plots (mean square COP displacement vs time interval). In addition, significant inter-subject differences were found in the calculated results. This suggests that the steady-state behavior of the control mechanisms involved in maintaining erect posture can be quite variable even amongst a population of age-matched, anthropometrically similar, healthy individuals. These posturographic analyses also demonstrated that COP trajectories could be modelled as fractional Brownian motion and that at least two control systems-a short-term mechanism and a long-term mechanism-were operating during quit standing. More specifically, the present results suggest that over short-term intervals open-loop control schemes are utilized by the postural control system, whereas over long-term intervals closed-loop control mechanisms are called into play. This work strongly supports the position that much can be learned about the functional organization of the postural control system by studying the steady-state behavior of the human body during periods of undisturbed stance.},

abstract = {How rudimentary movements evolve into sophisticated ones during development remains unclear. It is often assumed that the primitive patterns of neural control are suppressed during development, replaced by entirely new patterns. Here we identified the basic patterns of lumbosacral motoneuron activity from multimuscle recordings in stepping neonates, toddlers, preschoolers, and adults. Surprisingly, we found that the two basic patterns of stepping neonates are retained through development, augmented by two new patterns first revealed in toddlers. Markedly similar patterns were observed also in the rat, cat, macaque, and guineafowl, consistent with the hypothesis that, despite substantial phylogenetic distances and morphological differences, locomotion in several animal species is built starting from common primitives, perhaps related to a common ancestral neural network.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first actor-critic al- gorithm for off-policy reinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights. Pre- vious work on actor-critic algorithms is lim- ited to the on-policy setting and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off- policy gradient temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another (behavior) policy. For many problems, how- ever, actor-critic methods are more practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a large action space. In this pa- per, we illustrate how to practically combine the generality and learning potential of off- policy learning with the flexibility in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental, linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces, prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms, and empirically show better or comparable per- formance to existing algorithms on standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems. The reinforcement learning framework is a gen},

abstract = {Despite their wide clinical application and success, our understanding of the biomechanical effects of foot orthoses is relatively limited. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of medially wedged and laterally wedged foot orthoses on the kinematics and joint moments of the rearfoot complex, knee, hip and pelvis and the ground reaction forces. The principal effect of the foot orthoses was on the rearfoot complex, where significant changes in joint rotations and moments were observed. Medially wedged orthoses decreased rearfoot pronation and increased the laterally directed ground reaction force during the contact phase, suggesting reduced shock attenuation. The laterally wedged orthoses increased rearfoot pronation and decreased the laterally directed ground reaction force during the contact phase, suggesting increased shock attenuation. The effects of the orthoses on knee, hip and pelvis kinematics were generally minimal. In view of the minimal effect the orthoses had on joints proximal to the foot, it is suggested that the orthoses may have additional effects on the passive and active soft tissues of the lower limb and it is these changes that result in the documented clinical success.},

The function of the toes was assessed by reference to the time they were in contact with the ground and the peak pressures they exerted individually in comparison with other parts of the foot. The toes were in contact for about three-quarters of the stance phase of gait and exerted peak pressures similar to those of the metatarsal region. When the foot was bearing the second peak of total force, the area in contact with the ground (the metatarsal heads and toes) was decreasing.},

Our ultimate goal is to establish a design principle of a controller in order to achieve natural human-like locomotion. We suggest dynamical movement primitives as a central pattern generator (CPG) of a biped robot, an approach we have previously proposed for learning and encoding complex human movements. Demonstrated trajectories are learned through movement primitives by locally weighted regression, and the frequency of the learned trajectories is adjusted automatically by a novel frequency adaptation algorithm based on phase resetting and entrainment of coupled oscillators. Numerical simulations and experimental implementation on a physical robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed locomotion controller.},

abstract = {In this paper six theories of bipedal walking, and the evidence in support of the theories, are reviewed. They include: evolution, minimising energy consumption, maturation in children, central pattern generators, linking control and effect, and robots on two legs. Specifically, the six theories posit that: (1) bipedalism is the fundamental evolutionary adaptation that sets hominids-and therefore humans-apart from other primates; (2) locomotion is the translation of the centre of gravity along a pathway requiring the least expenditure of energy; (3) when a young child takes its first few halting steps, his or her biomechanical strategy is to minimise the risk of falling; (4) a dedicated network of interneurons in the spinal cord generates the rhythm and cyclic pattern of electromyographic signals that give rise to bipedal gait; (5) bipedal locomotion is generated through global entrainment of the neural system on the one hand, and the musculoskeletal system plus environment on the other; and (6) powered dynamic gait in a bipedal robot can be realised only through a strategy which is based on stability and real-time feedback control. The published record suggests that each of the theories has some measure of support. However, it is important to note that there are other important theories of locomotion which have not been covered in this review. Despite such omissions, this odyssey has explored the wide spectrum of bipedal walking, from its origins through to the integration of the nervous, muscular and skeletal systems.},

abstract = {Many control problems take place in continuous state-action spaces, e.g., as in manipulator robotics, where the control objective is of- ten defined as finding a desired trajectory that reaches a particular goal state. While reinforcement learning offers a theoretical frame- work to learn such control policies from scratch, its applicability to higher dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather limited to date. Instead of learning from scratch, in this paper we suggest to learn a desired complex control policy by transforming an existing simple canonical control policy. For this purpose, we represent canonical policies in terms of differential equations with well-defined attractor properties. By nonlinearly transforming the canonical attractor dynamics using techniques from nonparametric regression, almost arbitrary new nonlinear policies can be gener- ated without losing the stability properties of the canonical sys- tem. We demonstrate our techniques in the context of learning a set of movement skills for a humanoid robot from demonstrations of a human teacher. Policies are acquired rapidly, and, due to the properties of well formulated differential equations, can be re-used and modified on-line under dynamic changes of the environment. The linear parameterization of nonparametric regression moreover lends itself to recognize and classify previously learned movement skills. Evaluations in simulations and on an actual 30 degree-of- freedom humanoid robot exemplify the feasibility and robustness of our approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare overground and treadmill ambulation for possible differences in gait temporal variables and leg joint kinematics. DESIGN: A human subject trial of walking in two conditions. BACKGROUND: The treadmill is frequently used to simulate overground ambulation; however, the literature shows a wide difference of opinion as to whether the treadmill replicates the overground environment. METHODS: A total of 17 uninjured subjects walked overground at their preferred velocity. The treadmill was then set at the average velocity obtained in overground walking. Gait temporal variables and leg joint kinematics were analysed using the three dimensional (3D) Kinemetrix Motion Analysis System. The data were analysed separately for the two gender groups and for the groups combined. RESULTS: In the females, only the maximum hip flexion angle was significantly different in the two conditions with greater flexion occurring on the treadmill. For males, significant differences were noted between the two conditions for cadence and maximum knee flexion angle with greater values in the treadmill walking. When all subjects were compared, significant increases were seen during treadmill walking in hip range of motion, maximum hip flexion joint angle and cadence, while a significant decrease was observed in stance time. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant differences exist between overground and treadmill walking in healthy subjects for some joint kinematic and temporal variables. RELEVANCE: The results of this and other studies demonstrate that the kinematics of human walking differ in treadmill and overground ambulation. The next step in this line of research is to assess whether the kinematic differences in the two walking conditions are exhibited in different patient groups. If differences do exist in patient groups, then the interpretation of treadmill-based gait analysis findings should not be extended to that of ground walking, particularly where the patient has an impaired hip function, such as that exemplified after total hip replacement.},

abstract = {Understanding how the brain constructs movements remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system's ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we show that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain's ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and the subjects' adaptation to new force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie the learning of dynamics.},

@article{Geyer2006,
abstract = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

@article{Mann1980,
abstract = {A biomechanical study of 13 runners which consisted of 2 male sprinters, 5 experienced joggers, and 6 elite long-distance runners were studied. We obtained hip, knee, and ankle joints motions in the sagittal plane and electromyographic data from specific muscle groups. As the speed of gait increased, the length of stance phase progressively decreased from 62\% for walking to 31\% for running and to 22\% for sprinting. The sagittal plane motion increased as the speed of gait increased. Generally speaking, the body lowers its center of gravity with the increased speed by increasing flexion of the hips and knees and magnifying dorsiflexion at the ankle joint. Electromyographic activity about the knee demonstrated increased activity in the quadricep muscle group and hamstring group with increased speed. Muscle function about the ankle joint demonstrated that the posterior calf musculature which normally functions during the midstance phase in walking became a late swing phase muscle and was active through the first 80\% of stance phase, as compared to 15\% in walking. Beside the changes in the electromyographic activity of the muscles, the anterior compartment muscles of the calf undergo a concentric contracture at the time of initial floor contact during running and sprinting but undergo an eccentric contraction during walking.},
