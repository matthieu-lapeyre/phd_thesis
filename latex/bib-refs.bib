  abstract =      {We demonstrate that an irreducibly simple,
                   uncontrolled, two-dimensional, two-link model,
                   vaguely resembling human legs, can walk down a
                   shallow slope, powered only by gravity. This model is
                   the simplest special case of the passive-dynamic
                   models pioneered by McGeer (1990a). It has two rigid
                   massless legs hinged at the hip, a point-mass at the
                   hip, and infinitesimal point-masses at the feet. The
                   feet have plastic (no-slip, no-bounce) collisions
                   with the slope surface, except during forward
                   swinging, when geometric interference (foot scuffing)
                   is ignored. After nondimensionalizing the governing
                   equations, the model has only one free parameter, the
                   ramp slope gamma. This model shows stable walking
                   modes similar to more elaborate models, but allows
                   some use of analytic methods to study its dynamics.
                   The analytic calculations find initial conditions and
                   stability estimates for period-one gait limit cycles.
                   The model exhibits two period-one gait cycles, one of
                   which is stable when 0 < gamma < 0.015 rad. With
                   increasing gamma, stable cycles of higher periods
                   appear, and the walking-like motions apparently
                   become chaotic through a sequence of period
                   doublings. Scaling laws for the model predict that
                   walking speed is proportional to stance angle, stance
                   angle is proportional to gamma 1/3, and that the
                   gravitational power used is proportional to v4 where
                   v is the velocity along the slope.},

  year =          {2006},
  abstract =      {The plantigrade human foot rolls over the ground
                   during each walking step, roughly analogous to a
                   wheel. The center of pressure progresses on the
                   ground like a wheel of radius 0.3 L (leg length). We
                   examined the effect of varying foot curvature on the
                   mechanics and energetics of walking. We controlled
                   curvature by attaching rigid arc shapes of various
                   radii to the bottoms of rigid boots restricting ankle
                   motion. We measured mechanical work performed on the
                   center of mass (COM), and net metabolic rate, in
                   human subjects (N=10) walking with seven arc radii
                   from 0.02-0.40 m. Simple models of dynamic walking
                   predict that redirection of COM velocity requires
                   step-to-step transition work, decreasing
                   quadratically with arc radius. Metabolic cost would
                   be expected to change in proportion to mechanical
                   work. We measured the average rate of negative work
                   performed on the COM, and found that it followed the
                   trend well (r2=0.95), with 2.37 times as much work
                   for small radii as for large. Net metabolic rate
                   (subtracting quiet standing) also decreased with
                   increasing arc radius to a minimum at 0.3 L, with a
                   slight increase thereafter. Maximum net metabolic
                   rate was 6.25 W kg(-1) (for small-radius arc feet),
                   about 59\% greater than the minimum rate of 3.93 W
                   kg(-1), which in turn was about 45\% greater than the
                   rate in normal walking. Metabolic rate was fit
                   reasonably well (r2=0.86) by a quadratic curve, but
                   exceeded that expected from COM work for extreme arc
                   sizes. Other factors appear to increase metabolic
                   cost for walking on very small and very large arc
                   feet. These factors may include effort expended to
                   stabilize the joints (especially the knee) or to
                   maintain balance. Rolling feet with curvature 0.3 L
                   appear energetically advantageous for plantigrade
                   walking, partially due to decreased work for
                   step-to-step transitions.},

                   with other parts of the foot. The toes were in
                   contact for about three-quarters of the stance phase
                   of gait and exerted peak pressures similar to those

                   our understanding of the biomechanical effects of
                   foot orthoses is relatively limited. The aim of this
                   study was to assess the effect of medially wedged and
                   laterally wedged foot orthoses on the kinematics and
                   joint moments of the rearfoot complex, knee, hip and
                   pelvis and the ground reaction forces. The principal
                   effect of the foot orthoses was on the rearfoot
                   complex, where significant changes in joint rotations
                   and moments were observed. Medially wedged orthoses
                   decreased rearfoot pronation and increased the
                   laterally directed ground reaction force during the
                   contact phase, suggesting reduced shock attenuation.
                   The laterally wedged orthoses increased rearfoot
                   pronation and decreased the laterally directed ground
                   reaction force during the contact phase, suggesting
                   increased shock attenuation. The effects of the
                   orthoses on knee, hip and pelvis kinematics were
                   generally minimal. In view of the minimal effect the
                   orthoses had on joints proximal to the foot, it is
                   suggested that the orthoses may have additional
                   effects on the passive and active soft tissues of the
                   lower limb and it is these changes that result in the
                   documented clinical success.},
