\end{figure}

In 2012, when we started this project, none of the existing humanoid platforms were suitable for exploring the role of morphology. There were two kinds of platform. On one hand commercial robots that are rather easy to use and accessible but with a static and frozen morphology. On the other hand, prototype robots produced in labs to address specific experimentation needs, exploring interesting morphologies but complicated to use and impossible to reproduce outside the lab. In both cases, only a few were open source, limiting hacks, extensions or modifications of their morphologies even further.


In the Flowers Lab, we had both kinds of robot. We used Nao (see \figurename~\ref{fig:nao_platform}) to study human robot interaction (REF PIERRE cadeau). It was really convenient for use by researchers who are not interested in hardware issue since they are addressing more high-level research challenges. Yet such a platform is limited as it is not possible to modify the robot if it is not well adapted to our experiment. For example, back at this time the Nao camera was not efficient, with a closed field of view and a slow framerate. We have difficultly achieved 5 frames/seconds. Although we had the necessary skills to hack Nao and change the camera to fit our needs, its hardware was not designed to be changed. Improving the vision performance would only be possible with the addition of an external camera on the Nao head which would ruin the user experience. In addition, it would have been interesting to explore how the camera parameters (FOV, framerate, resolution...) can change the user experience but again, it is not possible with this robot (cite Pierre thesis).


We also used Acroban (see \figurename~\ref{fig:acroban_platform}) designed by Olivier Ly~\parencite{Ly2010}. It is a handcrafted humanoid platform created to explore certain morphological properties, especially compliance, with the aim of achieving dynamic locomotion and playful physical human robot interaction.
It actually allows modification of its is morphology but it is manufactured from aluminium mechanical parts, Robotis Dynamixel motors, scotch, and rubber bands cobbled together. Testing morphological variants requires lot of effort, in particular the manufacture of aluminium parts is complicated and requires either very good handiwork or a 3-axis CNC.

In addition, its use was quite complicated and while several researchers could have been interested by Acroban to study human robot interaction and social acceptance, it was not possible to use it without getting our hands dirty (à remplacer par une expression plus propre).
Finally, the material and manufacturing process make the platform non-stationary. Even if a lab manages to reproduce it, there is a high probability that the physical properties will not be the same. Therefore, the diffusion and the reproducibility of results are limited.


A last alternative would be the use of Darwin Op robot (see \figurename~\ref{fig:darwin_platform}) which is both open source and easily accessible (Robotis sells it already assembled for \$10K), yet as Acroban its hardware consists of manufactured metal parts making its morphology very difficult and expensive to modify (see section REF for more details). Moreover, even if Darwin is open source and very popular, to our knowledge its morphology has never been modified by the research community.

Thus one of the main goals was to successfully design a humanoid robot which can merge the advantages of both kind of robot, i.e. simple, accessible, reproducible and allowing to easily change and hack its morphology for scientific experiments that can be both customized and shared.


\subsection{An experiments-proof robot} % (fold)

Most researchers can attest to the difficulty and frustration faced while conducting robotic experimentation in the real world. We are daly challenged by bugs, technical issues, unpredicted events and side effects. While a bug in software can be fixed, an error with a hardware platform can cause damage to the robot and postpone the results of an experiment by several weeks.

Therefore many researchers in robotics avoid technical issues associated with the real world experimentation by using simple models and physical simulation. But the real world is extremely more complex and richer than the virtual one.
Some high-level behaviour experiments are conducted in simulators based on the hypothesis that real-world constraints are not relevant, yet it is really the case ?
Indeed, while the real world constitutes a lot of constraints, it is also rich in complex physical effects (gravity, friction, inertia), which should be taken into consideration and could be very useful if interacting with the agent.

As we saw in the related work (chapter~\ref{REF}), the emergence of complex behaviours appears thanks to the interaction between the real world and simple robotic systems. We cannot program behaviour because behaviour is the result of interaction  between the program and the real world. Thus we cannot design behaviour without the ecological niche of the robot~\parencite{Steels1991emergence}.

While using simulators can be helpful as a first step to design robots, it appears incomplete when showing results on the role of morphology without real world experimentation.
Therefore, when one wants to study the role of morphology on robot behavior, being able to explore it in the real world is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, current tools make the experimental step really hard to achieve for researchers.

Throughout our work on building cognitive and developmental learning algorithms, we have experienced these issues, especially while building and using Acroban~\parencite{Ly2010} and during the Ergo robot experience (see section~\ref{REF}). Much time has been spent debugging non-robust technologies but it has been very instructive for understanding those that are efficient and those that should be avoided.
Therefore Poppy has been designed based on the background experience we have acquired building using robots acting in the real world. Also particular attention has been given to these key-aspects:

\begin{description}
    \item[Robustness and Safety:] Demanding and lengthy real-world experimentation necessitates that the robot be robust and safe. It should be able to sustain experiments and fall down without easily breaking. At the same time, one should ensure that physical interaction with the robot is safe for humans.
    \item [Allow fast hacking:] Modifyinf the rovot should be quick and simple, therefore the robot has to be modular and allows the modification of any of its morphological properties.
    \item [Precision, stationary:]Experiments should be repeatable, implying that the robot properties should be stationary.
    \item [Breakable, repairable:] Breaking should not be costly and the robot should be easily repairable.
    \item [Transportable:] To allow for experiments in natural environments, possibly involving interaction with non-technical humans, the robot should be transportable outside the laboratory.
    \item [Easy and fast to duplicate:] If the robotic platform is to be reused in this way, it must be easy and fast to duplicate.
    \item [Affordable:] To ensure widespread use, a key factor is to keep the cost of the platform relatively low. The more labs can be involved, the greater the scientific impact.
\end{description}


To respond to these needs we created Poppy (see \figurename~\ref{fig:poppyv0.1_overview}).

\subsection{Overview} % (fold)

Poppy is a small and lightweight 25-DoF humanoid robot (see section REF), which morphological design allows for quick and simple modification by non-expert people. This is achieved thanks to the use of 3D printing technique for the mechanical structure, Arduino based electronical architecture (see section). Its motors are common and widely used off-the-shell Robotis actuators, and allow for compliant control and soft physical human-robot interaction. The pypot library (see chapter REF) allows programming beginners as well as advanced roboticists to control the robot and is adapted to the modularity of the Poppy hardware.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{poppy-overview.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Overview of Poppy beta with the main specs and features. This figure will be updated when the final release of Poppy will be ready.}
    \label{fig:poppyv0.1_overview}
\end{figure}

Its current morphology takes insight from the human functional morphology: large number of articulation (25 motors), the limbs respect human proportions, it has five articulation in the trunk and its thigh is bended by a $6\deg$ angle similar to the human (see section REF).

All the work and material to build, create and use Poppy is distributed under open source and open hardware licenses. The 3D printed skeleton and the electronics boards are under Creative Commons licenses (see section REF) while the pypot library is distributed under GPLv3 licenses.

Poppy is the first fully-open source and 3D printed humanoid robot, the design of such novel platform will be discussed in the next sections.



\section{Explore morphological variants} % (fold)

The whole structure must be easily reconfigurable both for repairing or hacking purposes. This mean the process to replace a Poppy's parts must be simple, low-cost and not require time or special tooling. Also, in order to have a real impact in the open hardware community, special attention is given to the modularity and the reusability of our technological bricks.
Poppy is fully modular (mechanic, electronic, software) allowing to freely explore and modify Poppy's body.
Its modularity and the use of 3D printing make Poppy highly hackable. Therefore it can be easily adapted to particular experimental setups and allows various exploration over its morphology.


\subsection{3D printed parts} % (fold)

We introduced for the first time the use of 3D printed mechanical parts in our work when we built the ergo-robot installation (Aout 2011 - see Chapter REF). The result was impressive as the parts were robust, precise, low-cost and fast to produce. Very convinced by this technology and desiring to be free to explore the robot morphology, we decided to build the whole mechanical structure of Poppy based on 3D printing techniques.

\subsubsection{Technique used} % (fold)

Several 3D techniques exist and were presented in the related work (see section REF). The Stereo-Lithography\footnote{This technique relies on a photosensitive monomer resin which forms a polymer and solidifies when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light.} (SLA) is very precise yet the material is not well adapted to support mechanical constraints.

Alternatively, we can use Fused Deposition Modeling\footnote{The FDM technique relies on melting and selectively depositing a thin filament of thermoplastic polymer (ABS - PLA) in a cross-hatching fashion to form each layer of the part.} (FDM), which has the great advantage of being very low cost (2000\$ for the printer + 40\$/kg of material) and therefore accessible directly in the labs. The part produced are good yet the finish is not perfect and require to be reworked by hand. Also the process create non uniform part, less resistant on one axis. Above all the FDM printers have low reliability leading to a large number of printing fails. Nevertheless low-cost FDM printers are really useful when we just want to produce first instance or single time use parts.

So we preferred the use of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)\footnote{The process uses a high power (25-50W) CO2 laser beam which melts and fuses fine powdered material spread on a layer.}. This 3D printing process allows the production of almost any shape without constraint. In addition, the price of the part depends on the total size and not on the complexity of the shape. This permits the production of very optimized shapes without increasing the total price of the robot. Moreover the use of polyamide material produces high quality part with very good mechanical properties uniform, lightweight, flexible and robust.

The table~\ref{tab:materials} compares mechanical properties of polyamide with classic metallic materials. We can notice the relatively good properties of the polyamide material. The young modulus represents the stiffness of the part. The polyamide one has a very low young modulus meaning it is very flexible while keeping a correct yield strength and a very low density.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{0.8\linewidth }{l X X X}
        Material & Mass Density $\rho$ ($kg/m^3$) &  Yield strength $\sigma$~($MPa$) & Young Modulus $E$($GPa$)\\
        \hline
        Polyamide & $930$ & $49$ & $1.65$\\

        Aluminum & $2700$ & $200$ & $70$\\

        Steel & $7500-8000$ & $350$ & $200$\\

        Titanium & $4500$ & $1200$ & $114$\\

    \end{tabularx}

    \caption{Comparison of material properties.
    The Young modulus represents the stiffness of the material while the yield strength corresponds to the maximal stress tolerable before plastic deformation.}
    \label{tab:materials}
\end{table}

A SLS printer is much too costly for a labs, yet sourcing the production to external company\footnote{\url{http://i.materialise.com/}} is really easy\footnote{In most cases, the company offers automatic scalable orders through on-line platform} and relatively low cost\footnote{Printing all the parts to build a Poppy costs about 1200\texteuro HT.}

\subsection{Exploring morphological variants} % (fold)
The 3D printing is a central aspect in Poppy to permit the exploration of morphological variant. Indeed it is now cheap and easy to produce custom part, and because Poppy is open source, anyone has access to the source files and can freely change the parameters he wants. Therefore it is possible to easily change the mechanical structure and properties just by tuning associated parameters in the source file and re-printing the part (see \figurename~\ref{fig:exploring-morpho-poppy}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{morpho_variation.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Caption here}
    \label{fig:exploring-morpho-poppy}
\end{figure}


Moreover, 3D printing does not only permit to change the shape of a part, it can actually produce it with different material. In particular, Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) - very similar with the SLS process - permits to produce the same parts using materials such as steel\footnote{http://i.materialise.com/materials/stainless-steel} or titanium\footnote{\url{http://i.materialise.com/materials/titanium}}. It is therefore possible to extend the exploration to material mechanical properties (e.g. flexibility, density).


\subsection{Scalable actuation} % (fold)

As explained in the chapter REF, the chosen methodology relies on the all-in-one Robotis actuator. They are really convenient to use as they directly embed drivers, encoders and communication bus. They are also quite powerful, robust and rather precise. This is done by the combination of Maxon motors, metal gearbox and precise magnetic rotation sensor (resolution: 0.1\textsuperscript{o}).

Also Robotis offers a range of motors with different actuation power (see \figurename~\ref{fig:dynamixel_powa}). They are different in size and power but their API remains the same and we can easily switch from one to another without neither changing the code nor the electronic integration. Yet, even if the size change, the foot-print keeps the same pattern (see \figurename~\ref{fig:dynamixel_dimension}).

Poppy is designed with Solidworks, a parametric modeler which offers features like configurations\footnote{Configurations allow to create multiple variations of a part or assembly model within a single document. Configurations provide a convenient way to develop and manage families of models with different dimensions, components, or other parameters.}, which define set of parameters. It is therefore possible to create for each part the configuration compatible with each motors just by setting the suitable parameters. The figure \figurename~\ref{fig:leg_configuration} shows an example with Poppy's leg. It just takes a couple of minute to transform a part designed for Dynamixel MX-28 to one compatible with Dynamixel MX-64. Then it is possible to switch from one to another with one click.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{leg_configuration.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Poppy's leg configuration.}
    \label{fig:leg_configuration}
\end{figure}

On Poppy, most of the parts are already distributed with multiple configuration suitable for different motors power. It permits to scale the actuation power and introduce it also as an experimental - discrete - variable.


\subsection{Electronic} % (fold)

Unlike the mechanical parts, there is no quick and low-cost solution allowing to produce custom electronic yet.
However, exploring the morphology may also required varying the sensors space (e.g. number, type, properties, positions). As we explained in the chapter REF, we address this challenge through the use of the Arduino environment.

Arduino has developed both hardware and software allowing to create and program electronics systems very easily. Their boards have plenty of I/O pins (digital and analog) suitable to power and control almost any electronics components. Also these pins can be used to handle low-level communication such as UART, SPI and I2C, useful to plug sub-module (e.g. IMU, LCD Matrix, tactile interface and so on).
The software they developed abstract very well the complexity of low level control\footnote{we can turn a led on/off with just one line of code.} and communication\footnote{Using just printf-like functions we can communicate on serial bus.}. Therefore, it allows a wide variety and flexibility to extend the electronic system while keeping an ease of use adapted to non-expert audience.
In addition, Arduino has an growing community -already pretty big- which creates, shares and produces low-cost, various and multipurpose electronic components. Actually almost of kind of sensors have an Arduino version with ready-to-use hardware and software.

Being able to change easily change the morphology is a paramount importance in the Poppy project. Using Arduino-compatible architecture permits an electronic modularity, which allow to consider the sensory-motor space as an experimental variable (see chapter REF).


\section{Lightweight} % (fold)

Many humanoid robots use powerful motors often associated with highly accurate sensors. This has a cost, both in terms of weight and computation resources. Moreover, to ensure the accuracy of the sensory-motor space it is necessary to design very rigid mechanical parts. The whole structure obtained is powerful but very heavy and due to inertia not very agile.
In the Poppy platform, the lightness is very important both for dynamical properties and safety:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for a given actuation power, reducing the link mass reduces its inertia and permits to increase the agility and the responsiveness,
    \item make Poppy a platform easier to manipulate and transport outside the lab,
    \item make the robot safer for people as well as for itself when it fall (and it will definitely fall a number of times).
\end{itemize}

The lightness was achieved by combining low-power actuation and optimized structure. Indeed when combined, it creates a kind of virtuous circle where the reduction of the maximum torque reduces the strength on mechanical parts. Because less force intensity is applied, we can remove material from parts. Because we have a lighter mechanical structure we can reduce the actuation power required and so on.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{virtuous_circle.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Caption here}
    \label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

Also using low-power actuation has several interesting points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The actuation being the main cost of the robot (>60\%), using the least powerful motors significantly reduces the total cost of the robot.
    \item Low-power actuators allows a safer robot. Indeed, in case of programing error, the robot is not enough powerful to hurt someone or itself.
    \item on a research challenge aspect, it constraints the possible motions to the one requiring few strength so certainly more human-like.
\end{itemize}

Therefore Poppy was designed using the weaker and lightest motors i.e. MX-28\footnote{Robotis motors are quite heavy (72, 126 and 153g respectively for MX-28, MX-64 and MX-106) in comparison of the Futaba servo-motors, 20-50g for a comparable output torque see \url{http://www.futaba-rc.com/servos/brushless.html}}, excepted on few particular joints (such as hip) while the mass reduction of the mechanical parts were achieved by using truss design.

Truss are a well-known design technique from structural mechanics to create lightweight yet very robust structures. It is mainly used in civil engineering (see \figurename~\ref{fig:truss_bridges}) but can also be used in plane, which require lightness and strength resistance.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{truss_bridges.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Caption here}
    \label{fig:truss_bridges}
\end{figure}

The principle is based on beam theory and permit to increase the second moment of area a beam cross-section (see \figurename~\ref{fig:leg_section}), which is an important property in the calculation of deflection, main weakness of a long beam.

The second moment of area is computed as follow:

\begin{center}
    $I_x = \iint_s y^2 dxdy$

    $I_y = \iint_s x^2 dxdy$
\end{center}

where $s = dxdy$ is the surface integrated along the two axis of the cross-section surface. We can notice the  on each dimension varies with a quadratic factor meaning the variation is not linear. Therefore matter placed far away from the origin is much more effective to increase the second moment of area.
Thus the main idea is to remove -the no effective- matter at the center and place it on the rim. In truss structure, matter is assembled by linkage avoiding local deformation.

The \figurename~\ref{fig:leg_section} shows the comparative cross section of two beam with the same second moment of area value. More precisely, the \figurename~\ref{fig:Poppy_leg_section} is a cross section of Poppy's leg while the figure \figurename~\ref{fig:basic_leg_section} is a basic beam with a rectangular profile.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
    \subfloat[][Section of the Poppy's leg]{\label{fig:Poppy_leg_section}\includegraphics[height=4cm]{Poppy_leg_section.jpg}}
    \hfil
    \subfloat[][Equivalent rectangular section]{\label{fig:basic_leg_section}\includegraphics[height=4cm]{basic_leg_section.jpg}}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:leg_section}
\end{figure}

It would require a section such as $b=27.72 mm$ and $h=27.59 mm$ for the rectangular to get the same quadratic momentum as the truss design (i.e. $I_x = 54.862 mm^4$ and $I_y = 53.260 mm^4$ measured with Solidworks).
Considering the length of the leg part (i.e. $190 mm$), the total mass would be equal to $142 g$ instead of $47 g$ for the actual leg. This corresponds to a reduction of 70\% of the mass.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
    \subfloat[][]{\label{fig:poppy_arm_truss}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{arm_truss.jpg}}


    \subfloat[][]{\label{fig:poppy_leg_truss}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{leg_truss.jpg}}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:poppy_truss_structure}
\end{figure}

All the limbs of Poppy are based on this structure and have been optimized using finite element analysis (FEA) to perform structural simulation and validate parts performance and safety factors.
Thanks to the use of this design on all Poppy's limbs (see \figurename~\ref{fig:poppy_truss_structure}), we managed to have -certainly- the most lightweight humanoid robot with 3.5kg relatively to its 83 cm height.

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)


\subsection{Electronic limitations} % (fold)

The electronic we developed is compatible with the exploration of morphology for sensory space because it has a lot of I/O ports to extend Poppy's sensorimotor space. Yet it has several limitations which make the final solution unsatisfying.

Commonly used electronic components are not designed for robotic integration but rather for building small personal computers. Thus even if the electronic boards are often quite smalls, they have big common connectors such as USB, HDMI, Ethernet which are of course never placed exactly where it should be for the integration in the robot.
Above all, cable are really annoying, they take surprisingly a lot of room (connector size, the wire length and they are heavy) while being totally useless for our applications.

Also the size of the IO Board is finally pretty big, more than expected and while it is still compatible with the Poppy design, it is too big with a too weird shape to be relevant for other open source project.

Great open source projects keep their work modular so other project can use directly one or several modules. Therefore the IO Board is not compatible with such principle and is currently under evolution toward the building of a modular Poppy electronics (we will discuss this new version in the discussion see REF). Yet this IO Board was the first electronic board developed in the Poppy project and the experience we acquire a better understanding of electronic integration. If we have to do it today we would make the same mistakes.

In particular, even if we tried to remove most of the necessary cables, we saw it is still complicated to make integration. We really have to develop board which do not require any wire at all.

Actually, I spent more time looking for the fitting cable on the web than thinking about the electronical architecture. The wire-problem is often under-estimated and therefore begin one the biggest problem for robotic. We experienced the same issue during the ergo-robot experiment and during the use of Poppy with artists (see chapter REF). SO basically, the wire problem is one of the most underrated issue.



Thanks to this methodology, we achieved the creation of the first fully functionnal Poppy in 4.5 months.
