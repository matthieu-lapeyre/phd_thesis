\chapter{Application: experimenting the role of morphology with Poppy} % (fold)
\label{cha:exploring_the_role_of_morphology}


In the related works we presented some scientific and artistic research showing the emergence of complex behavior thanks to adapted morphologies. In this thesis, we suggest a methodology to easily explore variation of morphology in the context of biped locomotion.
For this purpose we designed Poppy which permits, thanks to our design process, to quickly change its morphology.

To explore the role of morphology we need to do experiments on a real platform in the real world. The morphology became a experimental variable which has to be tuned, meaning you need to change it.
We decided to conduct experiments as applications of the way to explore the role of morphology with Poppy in the case of biped locomotion.

In this chapter,  we suggest to explore the impact of the thigh shape on the lateral stability and evaluate the efficient of foot designs for balance and biped locomotion.

Finding - What
Experiments conducted showed that the thigh shape has a strong impact on the lateral biped stability by improving it by 40 to 50%.

Conclusion - So What
Little change in the robot morphology (a thigh bended by 6Â°) can lead to major change in the dynamic behavior.
