\chapter{Changing Poppy's morphology} % (fold)
\label{cha:changing_morphology}


Poppy has been designed to be a new experimental platform opening up the possibility of systematically studying the role of morphology in sensorimotor control, in human-robot interaction and in cognitive development. Indeed, as we discussed in chapter~\ref{cha:morphology-review}, a suitable design of a robotâ€™s morphology can greatly simplify control problems, increase robustness, and open the way for new modes of interaction with the physical and social world. Thus, being able to study the body as an experimental variable, something which can be systematically changed and experimented with, is of paramount importance. Yet, until recently it was complicated because building a robot relied on heavy and costly manufacturing techniques, but 3D printing has changed the landscape of possibility.

We introduced a design methodology relying on the use off-the-shelf components and Arduino electronic architecture, for which 3D printing plays a central role in the production of mechanical parts (see chapter~\ref{cha:methodology}).

Poppy transposes this methodology to humanoid robotics, and it is now possible to explore new body shapes in just a few days. In addition, its size, weight and power actuation highly reduce the risk of self-damage if a programming error occurs, which means experimentation can be directly conducted in the real world without having to either use physical simulator or build a heavy experimental setup.

In this chapter, we present several experiments aiming to show through examples how the Poppy's morphology can be easily and quickly hacked  to explore morphological variants in the real world.
These experiments will be presented to show different aspects:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Experimenting the role of morphology (section~\ref{sec:morphology-role})
    \item Fast exploration of morphological variants (section~\ref{sec:morphology-variable})
    % \item Adding a novel mechanism (section~\ref{sec:morphology-add-mechanism})
    \item Adding new sensors to Poppy (section~\ref{sec:morphology-adding-sensors})
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion } % (fold)

The work presented in this chapter summarizes several experiments conducted during this thesis.
Unlike the work presented in chapter~\ref{cha:morphology-review}, our experimental results can be considered as preliminary and incomplete to clearly show and demonstrate the impact of the robot morphology over its dynamic and control.

Indeed, in this thesis, we are more interested in finding an appropriate methodology to explore easily in the real world the robot morphology impact rather than the actual exploration of the morphology. In this context, experiments conducted are more for illustration and evaluation of the actual way to change and hack Poppy. Toward this goal, confronting our methodology to real usage has been really instructive both to validate the design methods and highlight some non-optimized point.

After these experiments, we focused ourselves on improving the platform to make it more easy-to-use, easy-to-hack and robust to the real world. In this way, we decided to go outside the laboratory and put Poppy in non-expert users' hands. Indeed, as we explained, we are trying to construct a multidisciplinary community involving, therefore, multiple profiles more or fewer experts in robotics. Among these profiles, two potential usages draw particularly our attention: the education and the art, and will be discussed in the next chapter.
