\label{cha:exploring_the_role_of_morphology}


Poppy has been designed to be a new experimental platform opening the possibility to systematically study the role of morphology in sensorimotor control, in human-robot interaction and in cognitive development. Indeed, as we discussed in chapter REF, a suitable design of a robot morphology can greatly simplify control problems, increase robustness, and open new modes of interaction with the physical and social world. Thus, being able to study the body as an experimental variable, something which can be systematically changed and experimented, is of paramount importance. Yet, until recently it was complicated because building a robot relied on heavy and costly manufacturing techniques. 3D printing has changed the landscape of what is possible: Poppy Project transposed it to humanoid robotics, and it is now possible to explore new body shapes in just a few days. In addition, its size, weight and power actuation highly reduce the risk of self-damage if a programming error occurs, which means experimentation can be directly conducted in the real world without having to either use physical simulator or build heavy experimental setup.

As an application of the methodology presented in the chapter REF, and especially interested by the role of morphology in the understanding of biped locomotion, we decided to use Poppy to explore the impact of particular leg design on bipedal stability.

In this chapter, we suggest to explore the impact of the thigh shape on the lateral stability(see section~\ref{sec:experimental_thigh_shape}) and evaluate the efficient of foot designs for balance and biped locomotion.
