\chapter{Introduction} % (fold)


In the Inria Flowers team\footnote{\url{flowers.inria.fr}}, we are interested by the study of mechanisms that can allow robots and humans to acquire autonomously and cumulatively repertoires of novel skills over extended periods of time.

This includes mechanisms for learning by self-exploration, as well as learning through interaction with peers, for the acquisition of both sensorimotor skills (e.g. locomotion, affordance learning, active manipulation) and social skills (e.g. grounded language use and understanding, adaptive interaction protocols, and human-robot collaboration).

An interesting evolution of the last decades is the demonstration of the importance of the robot morphology for sensorimotor control, cognition and development (\cite{kaplan2008corps} \cite{steels1995artificial} \cite{Pfeifer06}). Indeed, robot behaviour cannot be preprogramed. The actual behaviour is always emerging from a complex interaction between the control algorithm, the robot morphology and the environment~\cite{Steels1991emergence}. Moreover, it is clear that an adapted robot morphology using specific properties can greatly reduce the complexity of a given task by ensuring implicitly a part -or the integrity- of the control required~\cite{pfeifer2005morphological}.
Finally, as Rodney Brooks argued, \emph{the world is its own best model}~\cite{brooks1991intelligence} and simulators cannot realistically handle the complexity of the real physic with multi-point contacts, soft materials compliance, frictions or unpredicted multi-modal interactions.


Exploring mechanisms of acquisition requires taking into account the robot morphology to be complete.
Therefore, we \textbf{should consider the robot morphology\footnote{The robot morphology is defines as any characteristic which defines the physical structure of the robot such as link sizes, number of links, joint characteristics, mass distribution, actuator characteristics, material properties, sensor characteristics and sensor placements~\cite{paul2006morphological}} as an experimental variables~\cite{kaplan2008corps} that can be tuned and conduct experiments in the real world}.

Where it is straightforward to explore and experiment variation of several parameters in software (e.g. algorithms, simulator), experimenting variation of the morphology on a real robot is much more challenging:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item how can we have an experimental robotic platform allowing both to change easily and quickly its morphology while acting robustly in the real world ?
    \item how can we make this work, mainly hardware, diffusible and reusable in the research community ?
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately current robotic platforms are not suitable to address such challenges.

On one hand, commercial robots such as Nao \cite{gouaillier2008nao}, Darwin Op \cite{ha2011development}, Nimbro Op \cite{schwarznimbro} or iCub \cite{metta2008icub} are easily accessible and easy to use. Yet they provide a "traditional" morphology (e.g. limited compliance, rigid torso, big feet, over actuated) and they do not permit the modification of their morphology. Moreover in most case, they are not open source and/or the hardware is to complicated/expensive to be modified.

On the other hand, lab prototypes are mainly handcrafted and specifically tuned which make them almost impossible to be reproduced in another lab.

The main issue of these robots are the chosen approaches and technologies used to design and produce them. Indeed, the classic way to design and produce robot is a complicated, time-consuming and an expensive process involving specific upfront tooling and complex manufacturing processes.


Within this context we decided to create a whole new humanoid robot called Poppy. This humanoid robot was designed to easily and quickly conduct scientific experiments on sensorimotor learning, exploring morphological properties, and human-robot interaction. As an experimental robotic platform, Poppy was designed to be \textbf{affordable}, \textbf{lightweight}, \textbf{robust and safe}, \textbf{easy to use}, \textbf{highly-hackable} and \textbf{fast and easy to duplicate or modify} with the goal to be easily reproducible and used by other lab thanks to an open source distribution (hardware and software). This was achieved thanks to 3D printing techniques, affordable off-the-shell components and optimized modular design.

\section{Introduction de la partie Poppy} % (fold)

Research in humanoid robotics has been thriving in the recent years~\cite{hirai1998development} \cite{kaneko2008humanoid}, both due to theirs predicted relevance for personal and assistive robotics~\cite{tapus2007socially} \cite{oztop2005human}, and because of the scientific challenges raised by robotics with regards to cognition~\cite{asada2001cognitive}, natural communication~\cite{stiefelhagen2004natural} \cite{breazeal2002robots}, biped locomotion~\cite{yamaguchi1999development} \cite{chestnutt2005footstep} \cite{collins2005bipedal} and full-body physical interaction with the environment~\cite{ude2004programming}.

But like the LHC is an experimental platform allowing exploring quantum mechanics and the origin of our universe,  humanoids can act as simplified and controllable human simulators. Thus humanoid robots can be amazing tools to study human being and eventually contribute in a better understanding of Human's behaviours and abilities~\cite{atkeson2000using} \cite{cheng2007cb} \cite{brooks1986achieving}.

A famous example of such humanoid uses was the Cog project~\cite{brooks1999cog} at the Humanoid Robotics Group of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This research project has two goals: an engineering goal of building a prototype general-purpose flexible and dextrous autonomous robot and a scientific goal of understanding human cognition~\cite{brooks1994building}. In particular, this project concentrated on embodiment and interaction intelligence with four aspects of a novel methodology: developmental structure, physical embodiment, integration of multiple sensory and motor systems, and social interaction. For this purpose they build several robotic platform such as a humanoid~\cite{brooks1999cog} (see \figurename~\ref{fig:brooks_and_cog}), and a very expressive multi-articulated head named Kismet~\cite{breazeal2003emotion} (see \figurename~\ref{fig:breazeal_kismet}).

The context of this PhD thesis is grounded on the same scientific motivations as the work of R.Brooks, R.Pfeifer, T.McGeer and initiative such as the Cog project i.e. exploring the role of morphology, cognition and embodiment intelligence in several aspects using real experimental robotic platforms.

The scientific approach of the Cog robots is oriented toward the exploration of embodiment in several aspects, from the low level mechatronics to head design for social interactions, but robots were built 15 years ago and using classic manufacturing techniques (see \figurename~\ref{fig:cog_project}) that made them expansive, complicated to be modified and especially difficult to diffuse in other laboratories.
We are now in 2014, the makers revolution is in progress~\cite{anderson} and novel technologies allow to rethink the way we design robotic platforms, especially humanoid.

In the previous chapter we presented a methodology to design robotic platform allowing both a free exploration of morphological variations and the diffusion in the research community. This method uses 3D printing to produce mechanical part, Arduino architecture for the electronic system and python-based API for the control.

We think such design methodology can contribute in building better experimental robots while it allows making the modification of robot morphology both easy and low cost, and by the use of open source diffusion, it permits the transfer and the reuse of scientific work in other laboratories.
Within this context we have built a whole new humanoid robot called Poppy\texttrademark (see Fig.~\ref{fig:poppy_with_me}).

In this chapter,  we will describe our motivation, the design guidelines we have followed and the details of Poppy's conception. We will describe with more details the open collaboration associated with the Poppy project in the chapter REF.


\section{Creating a novel humanoid robot} % (fold)

\subsection{Motivations} % (fold)

In 2012, when we started this work, none of the existing humanoid platforms were suitable for exploring the role of morphology. There were two kinds of platform. On one hand the commercial robots, rather easy to use and accessible but with a static and frozen morphology. On the other hand, prototype robots produced in labs to address specific experimentations, studying interesting morphologies but complicated to use and impossible to reproduce outside the lab. In both case, only few are open source, limiting even more hacks, extensions or modifications of their morphologies.

In the Flowers Lab, we had both kind of robot. We used Nao (see \figurename~\ref{fig:nao_platform}) to study human robot interaction (REF PIERRE cadeau). It was really convenient to be use by researchers those are not interested by hardware issue while they are addressing more high-level research challenges. Yet such platform is limited as it is not possible to modify it if the robot is not strictly adapted to our experiment. For example back at this time the Nao camera was not efficient, a closed field of view and a slow framerate. We have difficultly achieved 5 frames/seconds. However, we had the necessary skills to hack Nao and change the camera to fit our needs, but its hardware is not designed to be changed. Improving the vision performance could only be possible by the addition of an external camera on the Nao head which would ruin the user experience. In addition, it would have been interested to explore how the camera parameter (FOV, framerate, resolution,...) can change the user experience but again, it is not possible with such robot.

    \caption{None of the existing platform in 2012 was suitable to explore the role of morphology. Nao was impossible to modify. Darwin Op and Acroban used aluminium part really difficult and expensive to produce.}
    \label{fig:2012_Humanoids}
\end{figure}

We also used Acroban (see \figurename~\ref{fig:acroban_platform}) designed by Olivier Ly~\cite{Ly2010}. It is a handcrafted humanoid platform created to explore some morphological properties, especially compliance toward the achievement of dynamic locomotion and playful physical human robot interaction.
While it actually allows modification of its is morphology, its manufacture based on aluminium mechanical parts, Robotis Dynamixel motors, scotch, and rubber bands cobbled together requires lot of effort to be changed. Especially the manufacture of aluminium parts require is complicated and require either very good hand-skills or a 3 axis CNC.
In addition, its use was quite complicated and while several researchers could have been interested by Acroban to study human robot interaction and social acceptance, it was not possible to use it without getting our hands dirty.
Finally, the material and manufacture process make the platform non-stationary. Even if a lab manages to reproduce it, there is a high probability that the physical properties will not be the same. Therefore, the diffusion and the reproducibility of results are limited.


A last alternative would be the use of Darwin Op robot (see \figurename~\ref{fig:darwin_platform}) which is both open source and easily accessible (Robotis sell it already assembled for \$10K), yet as Acroban its hardware based on manufactured metal parts make its morphology very difficult and expensive to be modified (see section REF for more details). Moreover to our knowledge, even if Darwin is open source and very appreciated, its morphology has never be modified by the research community.

Thus one of the main goals was to achieve the design of a humanoid robot which can merge the advantages of both kind of robot, i.e. simple, accessible, reproducible and allowing to easily change and hack its morphology toward custom yet sharable scientific experiments.

\subsection{An experiments-proof robot} % (fold)

Most researchers can attest the difficulty and frustration raised while conducting robotic experimentation in the real world. We are daily challenged by bugs, technical issues, unpredicted events and side effects. While a bug in software can be fixed, an error with a hardware platform can cause damages to the robot and postpone the results of an experiment by several weeks.

Therefore many robotic researchers avoid technical issues linked with the real world experimentation by using simple model and physical simulation. But the real world is extremely more complex and rich than the virtual one.
Some high-level behaviour experiments are conducted in simulator based on the hypothesis that the real world constraints are not relevant, yet it is really sure ?
Indeed, while the real world constitutes a lot of constraints, it is also rich of complex physical effects (gravity, friction, inertia), which should be taken into consideration and could be very useful if interacting with the agent.

As we saw in the related work (chapter~\ref{REF}), the emergence of complex behaviours appear thanks to the interaction between the real world and simple robotic systems. We cannot program behaviour because the behaviour is the interaction resultant between the program and the real world. Thus we cannot design behaviour without the ecological niche of the robot~\cite{Steels1991emergence}.

While using simulator can be helpful as a first step to design robot, it appears incomplete to show results on the role of morphology without real world experimentations.
Therefore, when ones want to study the role of morphology on the robot behaviour, being able to explore it in the real world is of paramount importance but unfortunately, current tools make the experimental step really hard to achieve for researchers.

Along our work on building cognitive and developmental learning algorithms, we had experienced these issues, especially while building and using Acroban~\cite{Ly2010} and during the Ergo robot experience (see section~\ref{REF}). Much time has been spent debugging non-robust technologies but it has been very instructive to understand whose are efficient and whose should be avoided.
Therefore Poppy has been designed based on the background experience we have acquired building and using robots acting in the real world.

\begin{description}
    \item[Robustness and Safety:] Heavy and long real-world experimentations imply a robot should be robust and safe. It should be able to sustain experiments and fall down without easily breaking. At the same time, one should ensure that physical interaction with the robot is safe for humans.
    \item [Precision, stationary:]Experiments should be repeatable, implying that the robot properties should be stationary.
    \item [Breakable, repairable:] Breaking should not be costly and the robot should be easily repairable.
    \item [Transportable:] To allow for experiments in natural environments, possibly involving interaction with non-technical humans, the robot should be transportable outside the laboratory.
    \item [Easy and fast to duplicate:]Such a reuse of the robotic platform requires that it is easy and fast to duplicate.
    \item [Affordable:] To ensure a wide spread, a key aspect is to keep the cost of platform relatively low. More labs can be involved the better the scientific impact is.
\end{description}






% \subsection{Why being open source is so important ?} % (fold)

% Beyond the development of a novel humanoid robot, the open source aspect of the project is fundamental. Indeed, creating a reproducible and sharable robotic platform is one of the main goals of the Poppy project. We want to permit cumulative science with real platform and cumulative science is not possible without a collaborative environment, open source licenses set the official rules of such collaboration.

% They are fundamental as people are aware (at least for the main point) of what they can do or not without having to ask to the authors. They are totally free to use the material for their own work and encouraged to do it.

% Yet there are also other open source humanoid, Darwin OP and iCub but they use classic manufacturing technique and electronic architecture non-compatible with the exploration of morphology, in addition iCub is very expensive (\$200k) which limit its diffusion as cumulative science tools because few labs have the funding necessary to get one.

% Also being open source is not enough, you cannot just drop the files and let people do whatever they want. The creation of a user community is a key to actually transfer open source technology. Indeed, one fundamental aspect of the open source spirit is to create derivative work, which can be shared again.
